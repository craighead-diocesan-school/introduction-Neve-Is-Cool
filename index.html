    <h2>About me!</h2>

    <p>I am a Year 11 Student currently attending Craighead Diocesan School. I was born in Christchurch and have lived in Christchurch, Ashburton, Pleasasnt Point and now Gleniti. During these times I went to primary school for two years in Tinwald, and four more years at Pleasant Point, before coming to Craighead for many more years. I have a dog named Molly who is now five years old. Considering I can't think of much more to write, I am now going to go in depth into my favourite movies, because the amount of text will look aesthetic, and this is about the only topic I could talk about literally forever.</p>

    <p>
      I would have to say my movie of all time would be Titanic. It is just such a powerful and emotion-filled movie which I feel is just amazing to watch over and over again. Another thing about me is that I really like to re-watch movies, or television series, over and over and over again. I would have to say my second favourite movie series would be Romeo + Juliet (1996). I am a huge shakespeare fan, and to see one of my favourite stories brought to life gives me so much joy. I would have to also add to this list, the fast and furious series. Just the entire thing. I love the action-packed movies so much, and I really like cars which just makes the movie series perfect. Another movie I really enjoyed watching was sliding doors. I just like the whole concept behind it, saying how your life can durastically change for worse or for better depending on the small things. This movie also taught me that even if things seem to be negative, or something might seem bad, it could be the one
      thing that has kept me alive.

    <p>Now I am going to move onto my favourite television series, because I think three paragraphs will look very aesthetically pleasing. I love to watch TV, but my genres are all over the place. I love sitcoms. Any sitcom, you name it, I guarantee I will love it, my favourites have to include; The Office, Brooklyn 99, Modern Family, Parks and Rec, and plenty more. I've watched these all at least 4 times. I am also a super big gossip girl fan, and I love watching the inbetweeners. Some of other favourite shows includes Top Gear, Chernobyl and The Apprentice U.K.</p>
    <p>My interests include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Formula 1</li>
      <li>Music</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
